<h1>About the Course</h1>
<p>With "Programming Fundamentals," students begin studying the internal curriculum of SoftUni for comprehensive
    preparation as software engineers. The course explores fundamental concepts in programming, which form the basis for
    effective and quality training in professional modules. Students build upon the knowledge acquired in the
    Programming Basics course and start using more complex programming techniques and structures such as arrays, lists,
    objects, and classes. They study additional technologies essential for every software developer, like HTML and CSS,
    HTTP, bitwise operations, and more. The course also covers the basics of web development and one of the most
    widespread technologies and tools, effectively building the students' understanding of the upcoming professional
    modules and the knowledge they will gain from them to become successful software developers.</p>
